# Contributing

First, thank you for pitching in! Before contributing, please make sure to review and abide by the [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## 1. Find an Issue

All issues that have been approved for development, but have not been started will be labelled
as [Status: Dev Ready](https://github.com/CodeForBoulder/upswyng/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22%E2%9C%85+Status%3A+Dev+Ready%22).

We also move issues into the [All Issues project](https://github.com/CodeForBoulder/upswyng/projects/3) if you prefer to explore that way.

Depending on your familiarity with the various stacks, you may also want to filter based on the two projects in this repo:

- **Server** - [issues](https://github.com/CodeForBoulder/upswyng/labels/Project%3A%20Server) related to the [server project](https://github.com/CodeForBoulder/upswyng/tree/main/packages/server)
- **Web** - [issues](https://github.com/CodeForBoulder/upswyng/labels/Project%3A%20Web) related to the [web project](https://github.com/CodeForBoulder/upswyng/tree/main/packages/web)

### Provide Feedback

We'd love your comments on issues too! Some aren't ready for development and may not have a status label.
These issues may need more input before becoming dev-ready and will be labelled [looking for input](https://github.com/CodeForBoulder/upswyng/labels/looking%20for%20input).

## 2. Work on an Issue

Once you have have found an issue you feel comfortable working on, leave a comment in that issue that you'd like to tackle it. We'll label the issue as being in progress to make sure others don't work on it as well.

If this is your first time contributing to open-source or you need a refresher, see this [great guide](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions#first-contributions] that goes through the steps of contributing to an open-source project.

## 3. Create a Pull Request (PR)

Once you believe your feature is ready for production, create a PR and reference what issue this addresses in the PR's
description.

If there any updates requested by our code owners, please make those updates on your local branch and re-push that branch with your changes.

Once it's approved, squash and merge! After being merged, your changes will run through our pipeline and become live after it completes building.

## Not a Developer?

We need plenty of other types of talent! Please visit the [project page](https://www.codeforboulder.org/upswyng) on [Code for Boulder's site](https://www.codeforboulder.org) to learn how to get involved.
